# HR-Analytics-Using-PowerBI

The project aims to design a Power BI dashboard to track employee data for HR team which includes working hours,attendence,leaves for three months. The goal is to provide insights into attendence patterns and to differentiate between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) percentages.

# Steps followed

* Understanding problem:
 Defined the scope of the analysis, focusing on attendance patterns, retention strategies, and sick leave percentages.


* Connecting SQL Database to Power BI:
The SQL database was connected to Power BI, establishing a live connection or importing the necessary data tables into Power BI.

* Data Modeling and Relationship Creation:
Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables in the SQL database. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

* Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable.

* Dashboard Creation - Key Insights:
The first type of dashboard, "Key Insights," was created to provide an overview of the sales trend. This dashboard focused on presenting high-level metrics, such as total sales, top-selling products, sales by region, and sales by time period. Visualizations like charts, graphs, and KPIs were used to convey the key insights effectively.

* Dashboard Creation - Profit Analysis:
The second type of dashboard, "Profit Analysis," aimed to provide in-depth insights into the profitability of AtliQ hardware goods. This dashboard included visualizations and calculations related to profit margins, cost analysis, and product profitability. It allowed users to identify profitable products, assess cost effectiveness, and optimize pricing strategies.

* Dashboard Creation - Performance Insights:
The third type of dashboard, "Performance Insights," focused on analyzing the performance of AtliQ hardware goods. This dashboard provided visualizations and metrics related to sales performance, sales growth, customer segmentation, and market share. It enabled users to track performance trends, identify growth opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

Each dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.

Expected Outcome:
By implementing the above solution approach, AtliQ hardware expects to achieve the following outcomes:

Enhanced Data Analysis: The connection between the SQL database and Power BI enables real-time or near-real-time analysis of the sales trend. The solution provides users with the ability to explore and analyze data more efficiently, leading to better insights and understanding.

Improved Decision Making: The creation of the three dashboards (Key Insights, Profit Analysis, and Performance Insights) equips users with a comprehensive view of the sales trend from different perspectives. This enables informed decision making, such as identifying profitable products, optimizing pricing strategies, and targeting specific customer segments.

Increased Efficiency: By utilizing Power BI's data transformation features, data cleaning and transformation tasks are streamlined. This saves time and effort, allowing users to focus more on analyzing the data and extracting valuable insights.

Revenue Growth: With the ability to access key insights, analyze profitability, and monitor performance effectively, AtliQ hardware anticipates achieving a revenue growth of at least 7% in the next quarter. The data-driven decision making facilitated by the Power BI dashboards contributes to identifying growth opportunities and implementing effective strategies.

Overall, this solution approach leverages the power of SQL and Power BI to provide a robust data analysis and visualization solution, empowering AtliQ hardware to make informed decisions and drive revenue growth.
